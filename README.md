# LeetCode Problem Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Problem Solutions repository! This is a record of my journey as I solve various LeetCode problems to improve my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures. In this repository, you'll find solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, along with explanations and code implementations.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding and algorithmic problem-solving. This repository serves as my personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions, which I use to track my progress, learn from my mistakes, and share my solutions with others who may find them helpful.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **problems**: This directory contains subdirectories for each problem category. Within each category subdirectory, you will find individual problem solutions, each in its own directory.

  - Example: `problems/array/merge-sorted-array` contains solutions for the "Merge Sorted Array" problem.

- **resources**: This directory includes any relevant resources, notes, or templates that I use during problem-solving sessions.

- **scripts**: Some problems may require auxiliary scripts or utilities. You can find those in this directory.

## Problem Solving Approach

My approach to solving LeetCode problems typically involves the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: I carefully read and understand the problem statement, making note of any special requirements, constraints, or edge cases.

2. **Planning and Pseudocode**: Before jumping into coding, I plan my approach, sketch out a pseudocode solution, and identify key data structures and algorithms to use.

3. **Coding**: I implement the solution in my preferred programming language, ensuring clean, well-documented code.

4. **Testing**: I thoroughly test my solution using sample test cases, edge cases, and custom test cases to verify its correctness.

5. **Optimization**: If necessary, I optimize my initial solution for better performance or memory usage. I also consider alternative approaches and compare their efficiency.

6. **Explanation**: I provide explanations of my solutions, including time and space complexity analysis, to help others understand the thought process behind the code.

7. **Documentation**: I update this README.md file with links to the solved problems and their corresponding explanations.
